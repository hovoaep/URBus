# URBus
### *University of Rochester Shuttle Tracking and Route Finding*

URBus was created as a group project for CSC212: Human Computer Interaction at the [University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/)

It allows users to track University of Rochester shuttles in real time, find locations using Google Maps search, and get directions that chain together multiple bus routes and walking directions to the closest bus stops. 

URBus was created using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), and [Transloc API](https://market.mashape.com/transloc/openapi-1-2) (for the bus information).
